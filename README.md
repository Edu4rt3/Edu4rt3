## Hello, I'm Eduardo Duarte!
 * I'm a Computer science student, actually in the 3ยบ semester, starting my life as a developer,  I'm constantly seeking to expand my skills and knowledge in the technology field, with a particular interest in software development, in special using Python which is my main language.
